todo:
    tests:
        app:
            * ctp test

future plan:
    * linux support with cmake or SCons
    cxx_analysis:
        * namespaces


not supported:
    * namespace is currently not supported
    * c++11 strong typed enums(treat as traditional enum)
    * constructor is not supported
    * default arguments are not supported

hacks:
    * treat any virtual function as callback
    * if argument for a callback is pointer or reference, its value will be copied, modifying its value will have no effect
    *

    prepreocessor:
        * a better method to convert macro to constant
    cxx_analysis:
        * namespaces
    type hint:
        * enums and constants
    tests:
        basic:
            * async task
            * sync task
            * const, enum, class, function
            * py_callback
        stress:
            * py_callback
            * sequential for every task(dispatcher)
        hacks:
            * pointer arguments for callback_wrapper::asyc is really copied


not supported:
    * c++11 strong typed enums(treat as traditional enum)
    * constructor is not supported

hacks:
    * treat any virtual function as callback
    * if argument for a callback is pointer or reference, its value will be copied, modifying its value will have no effect
    *

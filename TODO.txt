todo:
    tests:
        app:
            * ctp test

future plan:
    * hint for wrapped c function pointer
    cxx_analysis:
        * namespaces
    generator:
        * python name can be different from cxx name
        * names for typedefs


not supported:
    * namespace is currently not supported
    * c++11 strong typed enums(treat as traditional enum)
    * default arguments are not supported
    * unnamed union

hacks:
    * treat any virtual function as callback
    * if argument for a callback is pointer or reference, its value will be copied, modifying its value will have no effect
    * c_function_pointer with void * -> std::function without void *(no hint currently)
